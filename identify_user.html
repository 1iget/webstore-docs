<h1>Identifying the User</h1>

{% endcomment %}

<p>
This page tells you how to get the Google Account identity of a user,
using Google's OpenID endpoint.
You need this identity if you support Chrome Web Store Payments,
because payment information is tied to the user's Google Account.
</p>

<p>
Even if you don't use Chrome Web Store Payments,
consider using Google Accounts
if your app needs a login system.
Google Accounts can help you provide a better user experience,
since users of the Chrome Web Store are likely to be logged in already,
and they won't have to set up and remember yet another username and password.
</p>

<h2 id="when">When to support Google Accounts</h2>

<p>
The following table summarizes when you should
support Google Account logins using OpenID.
</p>

<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
  <th> App cost </th>
  <th> Payment plan/system </th>
  <th> Support for Google Accounts (using OpenID) </th>

  <td> Paid </td>
  <td> Chrome Web Store Payment System </td>
  <td> <b>Required</b> <br />
       The Licensing API relies on
       Google Account user IDs. </td>

<tr>
  <td> Paid </td>
  <td> Custom payment solution </td>
  <td> <b>Recommended</b> <br />
       Users from the Chrome Web Store
       will have a better experience if you support the Google Account
       that they're already logged into. </td>

  <td> Free </td>
  <td> You <b>might charge</b> for the app in the future </td>
  <td> <b>Recommended</b> <br />
       Supporting Google Accounts might make adding payments simpler. </td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td> Free </td>
  <td> <b>No plans to charge</b> for the app in the future </td>
  <td> <b>Optional</b> <br />
       If you want to identify individual users,
       Google Accounts are a reasonable way to do so. </td>

<h2 id="how">How to use OpenID with Google Accounts</h2>

<p>
To get the user's OpenID URL,
you query Google's OpenID service.
If the user isn't already logged in,
the user will be prompted to sign in
with a Google-provided login page or popup.
</p>

<p class="note">
<strong>Note:</strong>
The OpenID URL is unique for a specific Google Account
<em>and a specific app</em>.
If you publish multiple apps,
the same user will have a different OpenID URL for each app.
</p>

<p>
Here's what the login page looks like.
Note that it has a Google URL,
not a URL from the app's site:
</p>

<p>
<img src="images/openIdSignIn.png"
  width="644" height="368" />
</p>

<p>
If you're writing a hosted app
with Google App Engine,
supporting Google Accounts is easy.
You just use the default
Google Accounts API authentication
and the Users service.
For details, see the user authentication docs
(for <a href="/appengine/docs/java/users/overview">Java</a> or
<a href="/appengine/docs/python/users/overview">Python</a>).
Here's an example
(taken from the
<a href="/chrome/web-store/docs/get_started">Licensing API</a> tutorial's
<a href="http://src.chromium.org/viewvc/chrome/trunk/src/chrome/common/extensions/docs/examples/apps/hello-java/HelloLicenseServlet.java" target="_blank">HelloLicenseServlet.java</a> file)
of the code you use
to get the current user's OpenID URL
if you're implementing a Java app with
Google App Engine:
</p>

<pre>
UserService userService = UserServiceFactory.getUserService();

if (userService.isUserLoggedIn()) {
  User user = userService.getCurrentUser();
  <em>/* ...Do something with</em> <b>user.getFederatedIdentity()</b><em>, which is the OpenID URL. */</em>
}
</pre>

<p>
If you aren't using Google App Engine,
you can get the Google OpenID endpoint
by sending a request to
<code>https://www.google.com/accounts/o8/id</code>.
See <a href="/accounts/docs/OpenID">Federated Login for Google Account Users</a>
for details.
</p>

{% comment %}
PENDING:
In Best Practices we might want to say something about
providing a UI for registering users
directly on your hosted app's site,
to support OpenID users who navigate to the site directly,
rather than going through the store.

<h2 id="realm">How to skip the OpenID approval screen</h2>

<p>
<img src="images/approval.png"
  width="300" height="" align="right"
  style="margin-left:0.5em; border:solid 1px"
  alt="the Google Accounts approval page" />
Normally, the first time your app uses the Google OpenID endpoint
to authenticate a particular user,
the user must approve your access
to their account.
To the right, you can see a typical OpenID approval screen.
</p>

<p>
Your users will have a better experience
if they never see the approval screen.
The screen is skipped if <strong>both</strong> of the following are true:
</p>

<dl>
  <dt> Your app requests only the OpenID URL </dt>
  <dd> If your app requests something else&mdash;the
    user's email address, for example&mdash;the
    approval screen is shown. </dd>

  <dt> You specify your app's OpenID realm in the Edit page </dt>
  <dd> Here's how:

    <ol>
      <li> In the <a href="{{ dashboardurl }}">Chrome Developer Dashboard</a>,
        go to the Edit page for your app. </li>
      <li> In the <b>OpenID</b> section,
        select the checkbox. </li>
      <li> In the text field that appears,
        enter the realm that your app will use to
        query Google's OpenID service. <br />
        This must be exactly the same as the value of
        the <code>openid.realm</code> field in your authentication requests. </li>
      <li> Save your changes. <br />
        They'll take effect the next time you publish your app. </li>
    </ol>
  </dd>
</dl>


<p>
If your app's code doesn't specify the value of
the <code>openid.realm</code> parameter,
look at your OpenID library
to see how it sets that value.
For details on how <code>openid.realm</code> is used, see
<a href="/accounts/docs/OpenID#Parameters">Request parameters</a> in the Google OpenID documentation.
</p>

<h2 id="resources">OpenID resources</h2>

<p>
You should use an existing OpenID library rather than implement your own.
In addition to Google App Engine's Users service,
you can find OpenID libraries in a number of languages.
Here are a few libraries we've used:
</p>

<ul>
  <li> Java:
       <a href="http://code.google.com/p/openid4java/">OpenID4Java</a>
       </li>
  <li> Python:
       <a href="http://code.google.com/p/google-app-engine-django-openid/">GAE Django OpenID</a>
       </li>
  <li> PHP:
       <a href="http://gitorious.org/lightopenid">LightOpenID</a>
       </li>
  <li> Ruby:
       <a href="http://rubyforge.org/projects/ruby-openid/">ruby-openid</a> and
       <a href="http://github.com/josh/rack-openid">rack-openid</a>,
       used together
       </li>
</ul>

<p>
You can find more libraries at Janrain's
<a href="http://www.janrain.com/openid-enabled">OpenID Enabled</a>,
and a full list at the
<a href="http://openid.net/developers/libraries/">OpenID Foundation</a>.
