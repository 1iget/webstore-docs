<h1>Migrating your App</h1>

<h2 id="assumptions">Assumptions</h2>

<ul>
    <li>You have written a legacy packaged app.</li>

    <li>You have published the app in the Chrome Web Store (CWS).</li>

    <li>The app has enough active users that you'd like to migrate them to a
        non-deprecated item type, rather than simply publishing a new, separate
        item in CWS.
    </li>

</ul>

<h2 id="overview">Overview of Migration</h2>

<ul>
    <li>Decide whether your new item should be either a Chrome App or else a
        Chrome Extension.
    </li>

    <li>Convert your legacy app to the new type, test it, and package it as a
        ZIP file.
    </li>

    <li>In the CWS Developer Dashboard, upload the new ZIP and specify the new
        type.
    </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="detail">Detail of Migration</h2>

<ol>
    <li>Determine the right type for your item.</li>

    <p>If your legacy app interacts with open-web content that your users browse
        to, expects to be in a Chrome tab, or needs a UI surface in the Chrome
        address bar, then it should become an extension. If, on the other hand,
        your legacy app is more like a native application and could be
        implemented as its own top-level window running side-by-side with Chrome
        rather than in a Chrome tab, then it should become a Chrome App.
    </p>

    <li>Prepare for new CWS requirements.</li>

    <p>
        The first requirement is that your manifest be updated to Version 2.
        Read the tutorial for migration to Manifest v2. In addition to certain
        manifest naming changes and the removal of certain deprecated APIs,
        Manifest Version 2 includes a default Content Security Policy. In the
        case of extensions, it's a good idea to update to CSP, but for Chrome
        Apps, it's a requirement.

        Finally, remove app:launch:local_path from your legacy app's manifest.
        This was the manifest key that determined that your app was a legacy
        packaged app. The next steps depend on which new item type you're
        targeting.
    </p>


    <li>If you're migrating to an extension, update your code to
        become a Chrome Extension.
    </li>

    <p>
        Skip this step if you're targeting a Chrome App.

        Read up on Chrome Extensions if you're not already familiar with them.
        The principal difference between a legacy packaged app and a Chrome
        Extension is that packaged apps had their own Chrome tab to themselves,
        whereas extensions generally enhance other web content that your users
        are browsing in Chrome. So you'll need to decide whether to modify your
        legacy app to operate as an enhancement to web content, or else fit its
        UI into the surfaces offered by browser actions or page actions.
    </p>

    <li>
        If you're migrating to an app, update your code to become a
        Chrome App.
    </li>

    <p>
        Skip this step if you're targeting a Chrome Extension.

        Read up on Chrome Apps if you're not already familiar with them. You'll
        need to understand the Chrome Apps lifecycle, and how to create an event
        page as the starting point for your app. The easiest first step will be
        to resurrect your legacy app in a Chrome App window. To do so, create an
        event page, and in the chrome.app.runtime.onLaunched() event handler,
        call chrome.app.window.create(), and for the url parameter, pass in the
        URL of the start page you had been using for app:launch:local_path in
        your legacy app manifest. Reloading your app should bring up a new
        window outside Chrome with your legacy app's content inside, and you can
        iterate from that point onward to restore any missing functionality.

        Once your app is running again, have a look at the new Chrome App APIs
        that are now available to your app. You might be inspired to take your
        legacy app in a whole new product direction!
    </p>

    <li>
        Test your app well.
    </li>

    <p>
        Some things to look out for: is user data preserved? Are all UI elements
        still reachable? If you're struggling to fit concepts from your app into
        the new type, consider whether you should change your app-or-extension
        decision.

    </p>

    <li>
        Upload to CWS and publish.
    </li>

    <p>
        Once you upload the new version of your product, the Store will
        automatically detect that it's a new type.
    </p>

    <li>
        Promote your new item!
    </li>

    <p>
        Congratulations! Your legacy app is now migrated. Let your users know
        about the change, and go find new users!
    </p>
</ol>
