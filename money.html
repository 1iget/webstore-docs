<h1>Monetizing Your Chrome Web Store Item</h1>

<p>
    You can publish Hosted Apps, Packaged Apps, Extensions and Themes in the
    Chrome Web Store. Collectively these are called simply "Items".

    You have many choices when it comes to making money from items
    that you publish in the Chrome Web Store.

    This page covers just a few ways to monetize your store item:
</p>

<ul>
    <li> In-app payments</li>
    <li> One-time charge (with optional free trial)</li>
    <li> Subscription</li>
</ul>

<p>
    Keep in mind that although this page features Google APIs,
    the store allows you to use any payment system you like.
</p>

<h2 id="inapp">In-app payments</h2>

<p>
    Items that use in-app payments are usually
    free to try. For example, you might provide a free game
    that offers additional levels or avatars for a small price.
</p>

<p>
    Generally, Chrome Apps and extensions can use <a
        href="http://developer.chrome.com/webstore/payments-iap">In-App Payments
    for Google Wallet with Digital Goods</a>, and hosted apps can use the
    <a href="https://developers.google.com/commerce/wallet/digital/">Google
        In-App Payments API for the Web</a>
    to charge for features or virtual goods.
    The fee for using the latter API is just 5% per transaction.
    For example, if you charge $1.99,
    you'll receive $1.89;
    if you charge $9.99,
    you'll receive $9.49.
</p>


<h2 id="onetime"> One-time charge </h2>

<p>
    <a href="overview.html#builtin">Chrome Web Store Payments</a>
    is a payment system
    that is especially well integrated with the store.
    With it, you can either charge to download the item
    or provide a <a href="overview.html#freevnot">free trial</a>
    that lets users try out the item before purchasing it.
</p>

<p>
    The charge for using Chrome Web Store Payments is 5%.
    For example,
    if you charge $1.99,
    you'll receive $1.89.
    See
    <a href="pricing.html">Payments: Regions, Fees, and Tiers</a>
    for details.
</p>


<h2 id="subscription"> Subscription </h2>

<p>
    Chrome Web Store Payments supports both monthly and yearly
    subscription models.
    As with one-time Chrome Web Store payments,
    you have the option of providing a free trial.
</p>
