<h1>Monetizing Your App</h1>

<p>
You have many choices when it comes to making money from apps
that you publish in the Chrome Web Store.
This page covers just a few:
</p>

<ul>
  <li> In-app payments </li>
  <li> One-time charge </li>
  <li> Subscription </li>
</ul>

<p>
Although this page features Google APIs,
the store allows you to use any payment system you like.
</p>


<h2 id="inapp">In-app payments</h2>

<p>
Apps that use in-app payments are usually
<em>hosted apps</em> that are <em>free to try</em>.
For example, you might provide a free game
that offers additional levels or avatars for a small price.
</p>

<p>
Hosted apps can use the
<a href="https://developers.google.com/commerce/wallet/digital/">Google In-App Payments API for the Web</a>
to charge for features or virtual goods.
The fee for using this API is just 5% per transaction.
For example, if you charge $1.99,
you'll receive $1.89;
if you charge $9.99,
you'll receive $9.49.
</p>


<h2 id="onetime"> One-time charge </h2>

<p>
<a href="overview.html#builtin">Chrome Web Store Payments</a>
is a payment system
that is especially well integrated with the store.
With it, you can either charge to download the app
or provide a <a href="overview.html#freevnot">free trial</a>
that lets users try out the app before purchasing it.
</p>

<p>
The charge for using Chrome Web Store Payments is 5%.
For example,
if you charge $1.99,
you'll receive $1.89.
See
<a href="pricing.html">Payments: Regions, Fees, and Tiers</a>
for details.
</p>


<h2 id="subscription"> Subscription </h2>

<p>
Chrome Web Store Payments supports both monthly and yearly
subscription models.
As with one-time Chrome Web Store payments,
you have the option of providing a free trial.
</p>

<h2 id="more"> More information </h2>
