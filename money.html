<h1 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/html">Monetizing Your Chrome Web Store
    Item</h1>

<p>
    You can publish Hosted Apps, Chrome Apps, Chrome Extensions and Themes
    in the
    Chrome Web Store. Collectively these are called simply "Items".

    You have many choices when it comes to making money from items
    that you publish in the Chrome Web Store.

    This page covers just a few ways to monetize your store item:
</p>

<ul>
    <li> In-app payments</li>
    <li> One-time charge</li>
    <li> Subscription</li>
    <li> Offering a limited trial version of your item</li>
</ul>

<p>
    Keep in mind that although this page features Google APIs,
    the store allows you to use any payment system you like.
</p>

<h2 id="inapp">In-app payments</h2>

<p>
    Items that use in-app payments are usually
    free to try. For example, you might provide a free game
    that offers additional levels or avatars for a small price.
</p>

<p>
    Generally, Chrome Apps and extensions can use the Chrome Web Store API
    to charge for features or virtual goods.
</p>

<h2 id="onetime"> One-time charge </h2>

<p>
    <a href="overview.html#builtin">Chrome Web Store Payments</a>
    is a payment system
    that is especially well integrated with the store.
    With it, you can either charge to download the item
    or provide a <a href="overview.html#freevnot">free trial</a>
    that lets users try out the item before purchasing it.
</p>

<p>
    The charge for using Chrome Web Store Payments is 5%.
    For example,
    if you charge $1.99,
    you'll receive $1.89.
    See
    <a href="pricing.html">Payments: Regions, Fees, and Tiers</a>
    for details.
</p>

<h2 id="subscription">Subscription</h2>

<p>
    Chrome Web Store Payments supports both monthly and yearly
    subscription models.
    As with one-time Chrome Web Store payments,
    you have the option of providing a free trial.
</p>


<h2 id="free_trial"> Offering a Free Trial Version of your
    Item </h2>

<p>
    The Chrome Web Store helps you to easily offer a limited-time trial version
    of
    your
    app to help you attract new customers.

<p>Whether your item is a hosted web app, a Chrome App, or a Chrome extension,
    you
    can
    use the Licensing API to check to see if the user has paid for your app
    to your users.</p>

<p>
    If your item is a is a <b>Hosted App</b>, you will use the
    a <a
        href="https://developer.chrome.com/webstore/check_for_payment">server-based
    flow</a> to check to
    see if user has purchased a license for your app. If the trial has expired,
    you can direct the user to the web store listing to purchase the app.

</p>
<p>

    If your store item is a <b>Chrome App</b> or <b>Chrome
    Extension</b>, you will
    use a
    slightly different <a
        href="https://developer.chrome.com/webstore/one_time_payments#verifying-payment">javascript-based
    flow</a>, that also uses the
    Licensing API along with functions built into Chrome to check the status of
    the
    downloaded trial
    app. Again if the
    trial is expired, you can the direct the user to the web store listing to
    purchase the app.
