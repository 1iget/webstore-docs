<h1>In-App Payments with Google Wallet for Digital Goods</h1>
<p id="overview">
    You can use Google Wallet for digital goods to sell digital and
    virtual goods within your <b>Chrome App</b> or <b>Chrome Extension</b>.
    The Google Wallet for digital goods client app, which is embedded in
    Chrome, communicates with the
    <a href="https://support.google.com/chrome_webstore/answer/1053354">
        Google Wallet</a> servers and handles all of the financial transactions,
    including charging the buyer and distributing the proceeds to you.
</p>

<p>
    The <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/developer/dashboard">

    Chrome Web Store Developer Dashboard</a> makes it easy to easy to create
    and manage virtual goods. You can provide localized descriptions for each
    product and offer items in local currencies. It also can help you to
    verify and manage licenses for the digital goods purchased by each user.
</p>

<p>
    In order to sell digital goods, you'll need to:
</p>
<ol>
    <li>
        Create a <a href="#setup-account">Google Wallet Merchant account</a>.
    </li>
    <li>
        Create the items you wish to sell via the Developer Dashboard in the
        Chrome Web Store.
    </li>
    <li>
        Include the appropriate <code><a
            href="https://github.com/petele/IAPDemo/blob/master/scripts/buy.js">buy.js</a></code>
        file
        in your package.
    </li>
    <li>
        Wire up the sales flow.
    </li>
</ol>

<p>
    The <code><a
        href="https://github.com/petele/IAPDemo/blob/master/scripts/buy.js">buy.js</a></code>
    file provides three functions:
</p>
<dl>
    <dt><code><a
            href="#query-items">google.payments.inapp.getSkuDetails</a></code>
    </dt>
    <dd>Returns an array of active items provided by your product from the
        Chrome Web Store. Maps to the
        Web Store API <a
                href="/webstore/webstore_api/inAppProducts/list">In-App
            Products List Method</a>.
    </dd>
    <dt><code><a
            href="#get-purchases">google.payments.inapp.getPurchases</a></code>
    </dt>
    <dd>Returns an array of items purchased by the user. Maps to the
        Web Store API <a
                href="/webstore/webstore_api/payments/list">Payments
            List Method</a>.
    </dd>
    <dt><code><a
            href="#respond-to-purchase">google.payments.inapp.buy</a></code>
    </dt>
    <dd>Initiates the purchase flow for a particular item. Maps to the
        Web Store API <a
                href="/webstore/webstore_api/payments/buy">Payments
            Buy Method</a>.
    </dd>
</dl>


<p class="note">
    <b>Note</b>: See <a
        href="/webstore/pricing">Payments: Regions,
    fees and tiers</a> for more information about fees and locations where you
    can sell your digital goods.
</p>
<h2 id="purchase-flow">Purchase flow</h2>
<p>
    You can use <code>google.payments.inapp.getSkuDetails</code> to get the list
    of available products, and then show those to the user.
</p>

<img src="purchase-flow-1.png">
<br/>&nbsp;<br/>

<p class="note">
    <strong>Best Practice:</strong> Before showing the user all of the items
    that are available, compare the list of items that they've already purchased
    (using <code>google.payments.inapp.getPurchases</code>) and provide some
    indication that the items have already been purchased.
</p>

<p>
    When a customer clicks a <b>Purchase</b> button within your Chrome App or
    Extension, Chrome uses the Google Wallet account of the user
    signed into Chrome to display the Google Wallet for digital goods payment
    processing window:
</p>

<img src="purchase-flow-2.png">

<p>
    When the user clicks the <b>"Accept and Buy"</b> button in the payment
    processing window,
    the Google Wallet server processes the payment and displays a purchase
    confirmation dialog to the user, as shown below. The <code>success</code>
    or <code>failure</code> callback is invoked appropriately.
</p>

<p class="note">
    <b>Note</b>: if the user is not signed up for Google Wallet,
    Google Wallet for digital goods takes the user through the sign-up flow.
</p>


<h2 id="how-to-use">Using Google Wallet for digital goods</h2>
<p>
    Using Google Wallet for digital goods is similar to using
    the <a href="https://developers.google.com/commerce/wallet/digital/docs/">
    Google Wallet for digital goods API</a> in a website, except no server
    side code is needed. The differences are summarized below and described
    in detail in the integration steps.
</p>

<ul>
    <li>
        The Chrome Web Store handles the list of digital goods available for
        sale, eliminating the need to create, store, or manage JSON Web Tokens.
    </li>
    <li>
        You can get the list of available digital goods through the
        <code>getSkuDetails</code> function.
    </li>
    <li>
        You must include the <code><a
            href="https://github.com/petele/IAPDemo/blob/master/scripts/buy.js">buy.js</a></code>
        library with your package, and
        load the library from its location in your package.
    </li>
    <li>
        You must call the <code>buy()</code> method with an extra parameter
        called <code>parameters</code>.
    </li>
    <li>
        The UI to process payments is displayed in a separate window, rather
        than
        in an iframe.
    </li>
    <li>
        The Chrome Web Store manages the list of purchased digital goods
        (licenses) for each user and exposes that list to you through
        the <code>getPurchases()</code> function.
    </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="setup-account">Setting up your account</h3>
<p>
    In order to use Google Wallet for digital goods, you'll need to visit the
    <a href="https://wallet.google.com/inapp/merchant/signup.html">Google
        Wallet for digital goods signup</a> page and create a merchant account.
    For more information on creating your Wallet Merchant account, along with
    step by step instructions, see the
    <a href="https://support.google.com/payments/answer/1619772">help page
        for signup for Google Wallet for digital goods</a>.
</p>

<p>
    Once you've created the Merchant account, you'll need to associate it
    with your Chrome App or Extension listing in the Chrome Web Store.
</p>

<ol>
    <li>
        Open the <a
            href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/developer/dashboard">
        Chrome Web Store Developer Dashboard</a> and edit the listing for your
        Chrome App or Extension.
    </li>
    <li>
        Under the In-app Products tab, click <strong>link a Google Checkout
        merchant account</strong> and complete the process.
    </li>
</ol>

<p class="note">
    <b>Note</b>: You can always update your Google Wallet Merchant account
    by following the steps in the
    <a href="https://wallet.google.com/merchant">Google
        Wallet for
        Digital Goods Web Tutorial</a>.
</p>

<h3 id="create-digital-goods">Create the digital goods</h3>
<p>
    Before you can sell any digital goods, you need to create the list of
    items that are available for purchase. The Chrome Web Store
    Developer Dashboard simplifies this process for us by providing an
    interface for creating digital goods and license management. This means
    in addition to the <code>buy()</code> function, you can also query to
    determine what items are available for sale, and what items the user has
    purchased.
</p>

<p>
    You can also choose to create your own digital goods, though you'll need to
    manage your own inventory and licensing service.
</p>

<h4 id="create-in-cws">Through the Chrome Web Store</h4>
<p>
    You can manage your digital goods through the <b>In-app Products</b> tab
    in the listing page of the Chrome Web Store Developer Dashboard.
</p>

<p>
    <img src="cws-dd-otp-item.png">
    <br/>&nbsp;<br/>
</p>

<p>
<ol>
    <li>
        Open the <a
            href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/developer/dashboard">
        Chrome Web Store Developer Dashboard</a> and edit the listing.
    </li>
    <li>
        Switch to the <b>In-app Products</b> tab at the top of the page.
    </li>
    <li>
        Click <strong>Add new product</strong>.
    </li>
    <li>
        Provide the necessary information:
        <dl>
            <dt>Product ID</dt>
            <dd>An identifier (SKU) you'll use to
                identify that specific product. Product IDs must start with a
                lowercase letter or number and can only contain lowercase
                letters(a-z), numbers(0-9), dots(.) and underscores(_).
            </dd>
            <dt>Title</dt>
            <dd>A friendly name of your product that
                will be shown to users on the purchase confirmation page.
            </dd>
            <dt>Description</dt>
            <dd>A short description of the item that
                will be shown to users on the purchase confirmation page.
            </dd>
        </dl>
    </li>
    <li>
        Choose the price tier that you wish to sell the item for.
    </li>
    <li>
        Click <strong>Save</strong> to save the item.
    </li>
    <li>
        Activate by changing the state to <strong>Active</strong>.
    </li>
</ol>
</p>

<p>
    If you want to prepare digital goods for release on a specific day, you
    can leave the state set to <code>Inactive</code> until you're ready to
    make those available. This means you can launch new features or levels,
    but keep them hidden until you're ready.
</p>

<ul>
    <li>
        You can have up to 100 items (active, inactive, or
        archived) at any given time.
    </li>
    <li>
        You should move older items that are no longer for sale to archived.
    </li>
    <li>
        Be careful when deleting items as users may already have purchased
        them and may lose their license.
    </li>
    <li>
        Once a product ID has been used, it cannot be used again, even if it
        has been deleted.
    </li>
</ul>

<p class="note">
    <b>Note</b>: Recurring payments are not currently supported through the
    Chrome Web Store interface; instead you'll need to manually create and
    sign a <a
        href="https://developers.google.com/commerce/wallet/digital/docs/jsreference#sub">
    Subscription JWT</a> and use that in your app instead.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h4 id="create-manual">Manually managing your own digital good</h4>
<p>
    Each item is identified by a <em>
    <a href="https://developers.google.com/commerce/wallet/digital/docs/jsreference">
        JSON Web Token</a></em> or JWT, pronounced like the English word jot.
    The
    JWT is a Base64 encoded, signed JSON object. Since each JWT is signed with
    your seller secret, you should always generate the JWT outside of your
    Chrome App or Extension and include only the generated token. If a
    dynamically generated token is required, you should create it on the
    server and serve it to the app via an XHR.
</p>

<p>
    You can generate JWTs using a server, or you can pre-generate JWTs for
    use in your Chrome App or Extension. See the
    <a href="https://developers.google.com/commerce/wallet/digital/training/getting-started/order-setup">
        Create an order</a> step of the
    <a href="https://developers.google.com/commerce/wallet/digital/training/">
        Wallet for Digital Goods Tutorial</a> for more information about how to
    create your own JWTs.
</p>

<p class="warning">
    <strong>Remember:</strong> If you use JWTs, you should generate the JWTs
    outside of your Chrome App or Extension and include the generated tokens
    in your package. If you need to generate JWTs dynamically or at run time,
    you should use a server. <strong>NEVER</strong> include the Seller
    secret you use to generate tokens in your app.
</p>


<p>
    If you manage your own digital goods, you'll need to manage your own
    inventory and licensing for those items and will not be able to use
    the <code>getSkuDetails</code> or <code>getPurchases</code>
    functions
    provided
    by Chrome.
</p>


<h4 id="query-items">Query what items are available</h4>
<p>
    The <code>getSkuDetails</code> function returns a list of all active digital
    goods available from the Chrome Web Store available for purchase by the
    user, including the product ID (SKU), title, description, and price.
    You can provide an optional SKU argument to the function, which will then
    return only the details for that specific item.
</p>

<pre>google.payments.inapp.getSkuDetails({
  'parameters': {'env': 'prod'},
  'success': onSkuDetails,
  'failure': onSkuDetailsFail
});</pre>

<p class="note">
    <b>Note</b>: The parameters field is required and must be set to
    <code>{'env': 'prod'}</code> to tell Chrome to use the production
    instance of the API. Review the <a href="payments-iap#testing">Testing your
    app</a>
    section for details on how to test your app without incurring a charge.
</p>

<p>The response will look like:</p>
<pre>{
  "response": {
    "details": {
      "kind": "chromewebstore#inAppProductList",
      "inAppProducts": [
        {
          "kind": "chromewebstore#inAppProduct",
          "sku": "70darkchocolate",
          "item_id": "aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa",
          "state": "ACTIVE",
          "prices": [
            {
              "valueMicros": "990000",
              "currencyCode": "USD",
              "regionCode": "US"
            }
          ],
          "localeData": [
            {
              "title": "Dark Chocolate (70%)",
              "description": "The best chocolate available.",
              "languageCode": "all"
            }
          ]
        },
        {
          ...
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}</pre>

<p class="note">
    You can find the full description of In-App Products Representation and
    Methods in the
    <a
            href="/webstore/webstore_api/inAppProducts#resource">Web
        Store API Reference</a>.
</p>

</note>
<p>


    For example, you might want to list the details of each object you get
    back from the function:
</p>

<pre>function onSkuDetails(skus) {
  var products = response.response.details.inAppProducts;
  var count = products.length;
  for (var i = 0; i &lt; count; i++) {
    addProductToUI(products[i]);
  }
}</pre>

<h4 id="respond-to-purchase">Responding to a purchase request</h4>

<p>
    The following code snippet shows how to initiate the purchase flow
    for an item managed through the Chrome Web Store:
</p>

<pre>var sku = "giant_tv";
google.payments.inapp.buy({
  'parameters': {'env': 'prod'},
  'sku': sku,
  'success': onPurchase,
  'failure': onPurchaseFail
});</pre>

<p>
    If you're managing your own JWTs, replace the sku parameter with the
    appropriate jwt parameter. For example:
</p>

<pre>var jwt = /* huge ugly JWT string */;
google.payments.inapp.buy({
  'parameters': {'env': 'prod'},
  <strong>'jwt': jwt,</strong>
  'success': onPurchase,
  'failure': onPurchaseFail
});</pre>


<p>
    When the purchase completes, Chrome will call the defined callback with the
    a parameter that looks like:
</p>

<pre>{
  "jwt": "eyJhb...0oFuU",
  "request": {
    "cartId": "00000000000000000000.0000000000000000000"
  },
  "response": {
    "orderId": "00000000000000000000.0000000000000000000"
  }
} </pre>

<h4 id="get-purchases">Verifying what items the user has purchased</h4>

<p>
    If you want to verify that the user has purchased an item and has a
    current license, you can call
    <code>google.payments.inapp.getPurchases</code>. The function will always
    return the most up to date information, and will reflect if the purchase
    was cancelled by the user, or refunded through the
    <a href="https://wallet.google.com/merchant/">Wallet Merchant console</a>.
</p>

<pre>google.payments.inapp.getPurchases({
  'success': onLicenseUpdate,
  'failure': onLicenseUpdateFail
});</pre>

<p>The Chrome Web Store will return the list of SKUs that the user has
    purchased:</p>

<pre>{
  "response": {
    "details": [
      {
        "kind": "chromewebstore#payment",
        "itemId": "aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa",
        "sku": "giant_tv",
        "createdTime": "1387221267248",
        "state": "ACTIVE"
      }
    ]
  }
} </pre>


<p class="note">
    <b>Note</b>: See the <a
        href="webstore/webstore_api/payments/list">Web
    Store API Reference</a> for more details on the payment methods. </a>

</p>


<pre>function onLicenseUpdate(licenses) {
  var licenses = response.response.details;
  var count = licenses.length;
  for (var i = 0; i < count; i++) {
    var license = licenses[i];
    saveLicense(license);
  }
}
</pre>

<p>
    In some cases, you may want to verify a user's purchase outside of a Chrome
    App, in this case, you can call the Chrome Web Store licensing server
    directly. For more information, see <a href="one_time_payments#verify-code">
    Verifying the license</a> in the One Time Payment documentation. Note that
    you will need to enable the Chrome Web Store APIs in the <a
        href="https://console.developers.google.com">
    Google Developers Console</a> to enable this scenario.
</p>

<h2 id="testing">Testing purchases</h2>
<p>
    Prior to publishing your app to the world, you can test the In-App
    Payment experience by publishing it only to <b>trusted testers</b>. When
    your app is published to trusted testers, the purchase flow will proceed
    normally, except they will not be charged.
</p>

<h2 id="sample-app">Sample Chrome App</h2>
<p>
    For a simple app that demonstrates how to use Google Wallet for
    digital goods, you can download the <a href="https://github.com/petele/IAPDemo">source code</a> here.

<p>
    Note, this app is not published in the Chrome Web Store to prevent
    accidental
    purchases.
