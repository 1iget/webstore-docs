<p>
When your app is finished, if not before,
you should upload it with the Chrome Developer Dashboard.
Uploading it makes the dashboard generate an app ID,
which you might need to complete your application's code.
If you're using Chrome Web Store Payments,
uploading also allows you to get the OAuth access token
that you need to use the Licensing API.
</p>

<p>
When your app, its Chrome Web Store listing,
and all the sites it relies on are ready,
you can publish your app.

<h2 id="step1"> Step 1: Choose a developer account </h2>

<p>
Before you upload your app,
decide which Google Account
you want to be your <b>developer account</b>.
This account will own your app
(or multiple apps, if you choose)
and will receive any payments you get from
Chrome Web Store Payments.
Instead of your personal account,
you might want to choose a dedicated account.
</p>

<p>
If you're working on a hosted app,
you'll need to prove that your developer account
owns the URLs that comprise the app.
For information on proving site ownership,
see the Google Webmaster Tools help article
<a href="http://www.google.com/support/webmasters/bin/answer.py?hl=en&answer=34592">Adding a site</a>.
Once you upload your app,
the Chrome Developer Dashboard will remind you if you need to verify
ownership of any sites.
</p>


<p class="backtotop"><a href="#top">Back to top</a></p>
<h2 id="step2"> Step 2: Create a ZIP file</h2>

<p>
To upload your app,
you need to create a ZIP file
that contains at least one file: your app's manifest.
It should also contain a few images
and any other files that the app requires.
The contents of the ZIP file and manifest
depend on the type of app you're writing
and its capabilities.
For details, see the documentation for the type of app you're writing:
</p>

<ul>
  <li> <a href="/chrome/apps/docs/developers_guide">Hosted apps</a> </li>
  <li> <a href="https://developer.chrome.com/apps/about_apps.html">Packaged apps</a> </li>
  <li> <a href="https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/themes.html">Themes</a> </li>
  <li> <a href="https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/index.html">Extensions</a> </li>
</ul>

<p>
Also see
<a href="https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/manifest.html">Formats: Manifest Files</a>.
</p>

<div class="note" style="margin-bottom: 1em;">
<b>Tips:</b>
<ul style="margin-bottom: 0.5em;">
  <li>
    Set the initial
    <a href="https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/manifest.html#version">version number</a>
    in the manifest to a low value,
    such as 0.0.0.1.
    That way, you have room to increase the version number
    when you upload new versions of your app.
    {% comment %}
    PENDING: Check whether you really do have to increase the version #
    even when the app is unpublished.
    {% endcomment %}
  </li>
  <li>
    If your packaged app or extension uses <a href="/native-client/">Native Client</a>, you can structure
    your application directory hierarchy and ZIP file in a way that reduces the size of the user download package. For details, see
    <a href="/native-client/dev/devguide/distributing#multi-platform-zip">Reducing the size of the user download package</a>.
  </li>
</ul>
</div>


<p class="backtotop"><a href="#top">Back to top</a></p>
<h2 id="step3"> Step 3: Upload the app </h2>

<p>
If you need the app ID or an OAuth access token
to complete your app's code,
then you need to upload the app
while you're still writing its code.
Otherwise, you can wait until the app is finished.
You can upload your app
many times before publishing it.
</p>

<p>
Here's how you upload your app:
</p>

<ol>
  <li> Go to the <a href="{{ dashboardurl }}">Chrome Developer Dashboard</a>. </li>
  <li> Sign into the developer account you chose in Step 1. </li>
  <li> Click the <b>Add new item</b> button. <br />
    If you've never uploaded an item before,
    you need to accept the developer agreement before going on. </li>
  <li> Click <b>Choose file</b>,
    navigate to your ZIP file, and click <b>Upload</b>. </li>
</ol>

<p>
If your app's manifest and ZIP file are valid,
then within seconds you should see a page that lets you edit your app.
{# PENDING: maybe show the edit page#}

<p class="backtotop"><a href="#top">Back to top</a></p>
<h2 id="step4"> Step 4: Specify the payment system</h2>

<p>
If you aren't going to use Chrome Web Store Payments,
you can delay or (for free apps) omit this step.
</p>

<p>
If you're charging for your app,
you need to set its price and payment system
through the dashboard's edit page for your app.
To use Chrome Web Store Payments,
you also need to sign up your developer account as a
Google Checkout merchant,
and you need to associate your merchant account
with the store.
For details, see
<a href="http://www.google.com/support/chrome_webstore/bin/answer.py?answer=96832">Register for a Google Checkout Merchant account</a>.
</p>


<p class="backtotop"><a href="#top">Back to top</a></p>
<h2 id="step5"> Step 5: Get app constants </h2>

<p>
In this step,
you use the dashboard to get any constants
that you need to use in your app's code.
</p>

<h3 id="appId">Getting the app ID</h3>

<p>
You can see the app ID in the URL of any dashboard or store page
that's dedicated to your app.
For example, the URL
https://chrome.google.com/extensions/detail/aaaaaaaaaabbbbbbbbbbcccccccccc?hl=en
has the app ID aaaaaaaaaabbbbbbbbbbcccccccccc.
You might need the app ID for several reasons,
such as if you use the Licensing API.
</p>

<p>
You can also see the app ID
when you get the OAuth token.
The app ID is listed along with other information
that you need when using the Licensing API.
</p>


<h3 id="oauth">Getting the OAuth token</h3>

<p>
If you support Chrome Web Store Payments,
you need an OAuth access token and access token secret,
as described in
<a href="/chrome/web-store/docs/check_for_payment">Checking for Payment</a>.
For detailed instructions,
see that page's
<a href="/chrome/web-store/docs/check_for_payment#token">Getting an OAuth access token and secret</a>
section.
</p>


<p class="backtotop"><a href="#top">Back to top</a></p>
<h2 id="step6"> Step 6: Finish the app</h2>

<p>
Now's the time to finish your app
and add any code that refers to the app ID
or OAuth access token.
You can update your app as many times as you wish.
Just remember to increase the version number each time,
as mentioned in <a href="#step2">Step 2</a>.
</p>


<p class="backtotop"><a href="#top">Back to top</a></p>
<h2 id="step7"> Step 7: Provide store content</h2>

<p>
Using the dashboard's edit page for your app,
add the store listing information
that isn't in the ZIP file,
such as a long description, screenshots, videos,
and links to related sites.
See <a href="/chrome/web-store/docs/images">Supplying Images</a>
for help on designing the images for your app,
and <a href="/chrome/web-store/branding">Branding Guidelines</a>
for information on how you can use Google brands.

<p class="backtotop"><a href="#top">Back to top</a></p>
<h2 id="step8"> Step 8: Pay the developer signup fee</h2>

<p>
Before you publish your first app,
you must pay a one-time $5 developer signup fee.
You'll see a reminder in the dashboard
until you pay the fee.
For more information, including troubleshooting tips,
see the <a href="http://www.google.com/support/chrome_webstore/bin/answer.py?answer=187591">Registration article</a>.
</p>

<p class="note">
<b>Note:</b>
If you used the Chrome Developer Dashboard before
{{ grandfatherdate }}&mdash;to
publish an extension, for example&mdash;you
won't see a fee reminder,
and you don't need to pay the fee.
</p>

<p class="backtotop"><a href="#top">Back to top</a></p>
<h2 id="step9"> Step 9: Publish the app</h2>

<p>
Publishing your app usually involves a few steps:

<ol>
  <li>
    <em>Optional.</em>
    Publish your app to test accounts,
    so a few trusted testers can try out the app and its install/payment flow.
    For details, see
    <a href="#testaccounts">Publishing to test accounts</a>. </li>

    <p class="note">
    <b>Note:</b>
    If you support Chrome Web Store Payments,
    you can't buy your own app using your developer account
    due to Google Checkout restrictions.
    You should first publish to test accounts
    so that you can test the payment system.
    </p>
  <li>
    Click the edit page's <b>Preview changes</b> button,
    and verify that your app's listing looks great
    and has all the information it should.
{# Check the button text. I'm hoping "Preview changes" will change.#}
    </li>
  <li>
    Verify that your app
    and any websites and supporting pages
    all work well and look as nice as possible. </li>
  <li>
    Publish any new websites and supporting pages
    that your app requires. </li>
  <li>
    Publish your app.
    For details, see
    <a href="#world">Publishing to the world</a>. </li>
</ol>


<h3 id="testaccounts"> Publishing to test accounts </h3>

<p>
At the bottom of the edit page for your app
is a <b>Publish to test accounts</b> button.
Clicking this button publishes your app
so that it's visible only to
people who are signed in to
one of a limited set of test accounts.
To specify these test accounts,
go to the bottom of the
<a href="{{ dashboardurl }}">dashboard</a>
and click "Edit your tester accounts".
</p>

<p>
When you publish to test accounts,
your app's store listing becomes visible only to you
and to people who are logged into those accounts.
Your app won't appear in search results,
so you need to give testers a direct link
to your app's store listing.
{# PENDING how to get this link#}
</p>

<p>
Publishing to test accounts is especially useful
when you plan to charge for your app using Chrome Web Store Payments.
You can buy the app using a test account,
and then use that account to log into the app
and see how the license server integrates with your app.
</p>

<p class="note">
<b>Note:</b>
To publish to the world after publishing to test accounts,
you first need to <b>unpublish</b> the app.
</p>

<div id="intl">
<h3 id="world"> Publishing to the world </h3>

<p>
Publishing your app is easy&mdash;just
click the "Publish" link next to your app in the
<a href="{{ dashboardurl }}">dashboard</a>.
Or in the dashboard's edit page for your app,
click the <b>Publish</b> button.
</p>

<p>
Publishing an app makes it immediately visible to the world,
and soon makes it visible in the store's search results.
</p>

<p>
With the developer dashboard,
you can choose the regions you wish to support,
determine your app's <a href="/chrome/web-store/docs/pricing">price in each region</a>
(if you use Chrome Web Store Payments),
and <a href="/chrome/web-store/docs/i18n">internationalize</a> your app.
